# Data lake using spark and AWS S3 

## Introduction 

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

this project scope is  building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to

## Project dataset

` song dataset ` : s3://udacity-dend/song_data .
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.

for example : 

` song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json `

` log file dataset ` : s3://udacity-dend/log_data

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by an event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset  are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to a file in a dataset

` log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json `

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema for song play analysis 

The data is organized into a star schema with fact and dimension tables. Analytics queries on the ` songplays` fact table are straightforward, and additional fields can be accessed in the four dimension tables `users`, `songs`, `artists`, and `time`.

## This project contains the following files : 

` etl.py ` reads data from S3, processes that data using Spark, and writes them back to S3.
` dl.cfg ` contains the AWS credentials.
` README.md ` provides discussion on the process and decisions.


## Run

1. Set environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
2. Create an S3 bucket and replace the `output_data` variable in the `main()` function with `s3a://<bucket name>/`, or uncomment the line below to run locally.

**Run ETL pipeline**

```bash
$ python etl.py
```
